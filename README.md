## Objective
To develop a social media platform where hate speech is automatically moderated. Our product aims to offer everyone an online community where 
freedom of speech is complemented by hate speech moderation powered by natural languauge processing techologies.

## Description

This social media platform leverages state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to tackle issues like hate speech and spam. 
Our platform offers a familiar social media experience while prioritizing user safety and a pleasant environment. Key features include automated 
NLP content moderation, text, image, and video posts, reporting, reposting with commentary, liking, commenting, user following/blocking, direct messaging, 
bot detection, and personalized user and post recommendations based on hashtags. Our aim is to create a vibrant and respectful online community.
This product will be Mobile and PC compatible. Users will require an account to access the platform. Users are invited to share posts in the format of
their liking such as texts and images. Users can connect with others by adding them as friends and messaging within the platform. To maintain a positive and 
respectful environment, all written posts undergo automatic moderation to prevent hate speech.
